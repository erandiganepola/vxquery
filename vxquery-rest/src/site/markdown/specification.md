# REST API Specification

Swagger configuration of the REST API can be found 
[here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/VXQUERY/SwaggerIO+Configuration). 

**NOTE:** This REST API supports both **content types**, `application/json` and `application/xml`. Based on the `accept` header 
of your query request, REST API will return the results wither in *json* form or *XML* form. Returned content type 
defaults to `application/json` if no `accept` header is present.

Base Path **${host}/vxquery**

## Query Request

Request of this type should be submitted for a given *query* to be executed. Depending on the value of the parameter
`mode`, a **synchronous** response or an **asynchronous** response will be returned

`*` required

| Path | Method |Parameters | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |----- |
| /query | GET  |statement*     | string    | Statement to be executed |
|       |       |mode           | string    | `sync` or `async`. **async** will return an asynchronous response **(default: async)** |
|       |       |compileOnly    | boolean   | If `true`, statement will be compiled, but won't be executed (default: false) |
|       |       |optimization   | integer   | Optimization level (0 - 2,147,483,647). (Default: Full optimization) |
|       |       |frameSize      | integer   | Frame size in bytes (default: 65536) |
|       |       |repeatExecutions|integer   | Number of times to repeat execution (default: 1) |
|       |       |metrics        | boolean   | If `true`, returns metrics (compile and execution time) with the response (default: false) |
|       |       |showAbstractSyntaxTree         | boolean | Shows abstract syntax tree if `true` (default: false) |
|       |       |showTranslatedExpressionTree   | boolean | Shows translated expression tree if `true` (default: false) |
|       |       |showOptimizedExpressionTree    | boolean | Shows optimized expression tree if `true` (default: false) |
|       |       |showRuntimePlan| boolean   | Shows runtime plan if set to `true` (default: false) |

### Synchronous Query Response

Received only when `mode` is set to `sync` in the query request above. 

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|statement* |string         | Statement submitted to be executed |
|status*	|string         | `success` to indicate that the query execution was successful | 
|requestId*	|string         | A unique ID assigned to the request sent earlier |
|abstractSyntaxTree	        |string | Abstract Syntax Tree if requested in the query request. Else `null` |
|translatedExpressionTree    |string | Translated Expression Tree if requested in the query request. Else `null` |
|optimizedExpressionTree	    |string | Optimized Expression Tree if requested in the query request. Else `null` |
|runtimePlan    |string     | Runtime plan if requested in the query request. Else `null` |
|metrics	    |metrics    | Metrics (`compileTime` and `elapsedTime`) if requested in the query request |
|results*       |string     | Results of the query/statement submitted for execution |

### Asynchronous Query Response

Received only when `mode` is set to `async` (which is the default value) in the query request above. 

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|statement* |string         | Statement submitted to be executed |
|status*	|string         | `success` to indicate that the query execution was successful | 
|requestId*	|string         | A unique ID assigned to the request sent earlier |
|abstractSyntaxTree	        |string | Abstract Syntax Tree if requested in the query request. Else `null` |
|translatedExpressionTree    |string | Translated Expression Tree if requested in the query request. Else `null` |
|optimizedExpressionTree	    |string | Optimized Expression Tree if requested in the query request. Else `null` |
|runtimePlan    |string     | Runtime plan if requested in the query request. Else `null` |
|metrics	    |metrics    | Metrics (`compileTime` and `elapsedTime`) if requested in the query request |
|resultId*  |string     | Result ID of the query submitted for execution. This ID is required later for result fetching |
|resultUrl* |string     | URL from which the results of the submitted query can be retrieved |

### Result fetching (After an Asynchronous Query Response)

The **resultId** received in the asynchronous query response needs to be submitted as a 
**path parameter** (`/query/result/${resultId}`) to the REST API in order to retrieve the corresponding results.

| Path | Method |Parameters | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |----- |
| /query/result/${resultId}    | GET | metrics | boolean   | If `true`, returns metrics (compile and execution time) with the response (default: false) |

## Error Response

In any of the above scenarios, if an error occurred while processing, REST API will return an *Error Response* as 
specified below.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|status*	|string         | `fatal` to indicate that the query execution was failed at some point | 
|requestId*	|string         | A unique ID assigned to the request sent |
|error*     |Error          | An error object which include an error code with an error message. {code: xxx, message: "error message"} |
